# INTRODUCTION
This project looks at creating a my portfolio website based on certain requirments detailed out in the readme text for the challenge. In summary they are:

## Challenge requirements
A Navigation bar with:
  links that are applicable to your portfolio and navigate to the appropriate sections
  
 A hero section which contains my name, other information of relevance and picture
  
 A work section displayed in a grid using bootstrap cards for each project, a brief description of each project and to contain a link that will eventually link to the project
 
 Skills section
  contains a list of skills exptected to learn from bootcamp
  
  About/contact section
  
  Hyperlinks created - should have a hover effect  and buttons should display a box shadow upon hove
  
  The bootstrap solution should minimise the use of media queries 
  
  In addtion to the above I will also try to make the webpage media responsive
  
  ## What I hope to learn from this challenge:
  understanding of using boostrap elements
  modifying bootstrap elements without manipulating the original code - use of CSS tag on selectors, bootstrap commands in HTML
  My biggest and hardest challenge will be using and understanding bootstrap grid and how to manipulate it to achieve my design result. It is likely I will use several resources which I did in the project which included:
  
  1. resource materials about CSS selectors and HTML from W school and MDN
  
  2. youtube videos to understand principles of flexbox, css grids and bootstrap grid system as well as how to manipulate bootstrap to make the webpage responsive
  
  3. use of html and css code examples to work out and improve a better understanding of responsive grids, flexbox and bootstrap grids
  
## What I learned from the challenge
1. I obtained a better understanding of bootstrap grid system. This took a while and a fair few trials in manipulating the html elements. In the process I learnt that nested grids for this particular project would not be suitable to portray the simplicity of my design. I also felt that nested grids added complexity to a simple structure web design. I wanted to learn the basic prinicpes of creating a webpage without adding complexities such as nested grid. During this process I also found out that CSS grids within the bootstrap environment did not function as expected so I needed to abandon that trail and focus more on manipulating elements within a bootstrap grid.

2. One of the shortfalls I discovered was that I was not able to re-order elements using commands (or it was not easy) so realised that the order of HTML needed altering to achieve the look needed for my webpage. This highlighted the importance of initial wireframe design before creating the html structure

3. New CSS commands acquired were: hover, box-shadow, manipulating backgroun-imaged to fit the container, creating flexbox to manipulate elements. I also learned from this that using grid-template-rows/columns. display:grid commands were not easy to employ to achieve the desired look

## More Work
There is more work to do on the webpage and with more knowledge I will improve some of the elements in particular the image with text boxes - which at present are not to my liking given the position of elements on the background image. The skills section is at present bare but I will add onto it as more knowledge regarding these new concepts are embedded into my learning process.
